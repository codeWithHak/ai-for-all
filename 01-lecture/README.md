# Lecture 1: What is AI and its importance?

## In this lecture we will understand what is:

- AI
- Models
- Api
- Value Of AI


## API:
Imagine you are an **API**

User asked you a question about **food** you don't know anything about **food**, but you know a **chef**.

So you will give that **user's** **request** a question in this case and ask the **chef** that question.

Chef will respond, then you take that **response** back to **user**

### Understand API example with flow:
User > You > Chef
<br>
User < You < Chef

### In reality:
**Request**:
User > API > Model
<br>
**Response**: User < API < Model
